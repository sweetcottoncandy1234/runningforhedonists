            <h2>First Serious 5k - Camp Gilead</h2>
            <p>Date: May 27, 2024</p>
            <p>I signed up for this because it was a cheap run that raised money for some kids camp near Redmond. Realized the kids camp was Christian when the prayed at the beginning. My aunt came with me and we were both very confused. Surprisingly ran in 33 minutes. Fun day! Ended with Korean Fried Chicken and a pint of Mac and Jacks.</p>

            <h2>Outdoor Running</h2>
            <p>Date: April 15, 2024</p>
            <p>Moved to Redmond in February. Did the gym thing for a bit. Realized that I was getting home at 9PM-10PM due to my job, and public transportation in Seattle at night is uh ... questionable? As a result I just started running outside. Started at around 6 miles per week, the same as my treadmill routine.</p>

            <h2>Mom Bought Me a Gym Membership</h2>
            <p>Date: Dec 25, 2024</p>
            <p>I think she wanted me to play pickleball with her but I only went for the amenities. Started jogging on the treadmill 3-5 days a week as an excuse to use the steam room. </p>

            <h2>Hot Chocolate 5k</h2>
            <p>Date: October 3, 2021</p>
            <img>Ran/walked on the trail surrounding Washington Park. My friend's family invited me. While I only ran on occasion, I thought it would be fun.</img>
